        <h2>Morning Routine</h2>
        <p>My job would most likely require me to have constant changes when it comes to schedules especially if the flights assigned to me have different time frame. But occasionally, I would most likely wake up at 5:00am to start getting ready. After a quick breakfast, I'd jog for about 30 minutes to ensure my body won't be sore after sitting for hours in the plane. Then, I'd review my flight plan, weather reports, and if there are any updates regarding the aircraft. Finally, after packing up my things, I'd head to the airport early for check-in and security. As I make my way through the airport, passing by passengers with their luggage as some go back home and some go vacations, I'd most likely be tearing up with some parents leaving their child for work and some finally seeing their family after years. Nevertheless, I'd put on a confident face to give the passengers a message that they're in good hands.</p>

        <h2>Midday Tasks & Projects</h2>
        <p>My main job would be to operate and navigate aircraft safely while ensuring the comfort of passengers and crew. I'd be working with co-pilots, cabin crew, air traffic controllers, and ground staff to plan and complete flights efficiently. Additionally, I'd be using tools such as flight control systems, navigation instruments, and weather radar, relying on skills like communication, quick decision-making, and teamwork to manage flights and handle any challenges that might come ahead.</p>

        <h2>A Story from My Dream Job</h2>
        <p>On 9/11, Heather “Lucky” Penney, one of the first female fighter pilots, was prepared to intercept United Airlines Flight 93, which was believed to be heading to a major U.S. target. She accepted the possibility of sacrificing her life to stop the hijacked plane from causing more destruction. Luckily, the heroic passengers aboard Flight 93 fought the terrorists and crashed the plane safely in Pennsylvania, preventing further tragedy.
